# Issue-01: Space Handling in Shortest Combined String Algorithm

## Issue Summary
The current implementation incorrectly removes spaces between words during string combination, violating the word integrity requirement. Spaces between words in the original input strings must be preserved to maintain word boundaries.

## Current Behavior
- The algorithm removes spaces between words when merging strings
- Words from the same input string are incorrectly combined (e.g., "is" + "a" + "son" â†’ "isason")
- The verification step incorrectly marks these outputs as "VALID"

## Expected Behavior
- Spaces between words from the same input string must be preserved
- Words can be interleaved between strings, but word boundaries must be maintained
- Character reuse should still be maximized where possible
- The algorithm should produce a shorter result than simple concatenation

## Key Requirements to Enforce
1. All words from both strings must be included in the output (Req 4.1)
2. Spaces must not be inserted within any word (Req 4.2)
3. Existing spaces between words must not be removed (Req 4.3)

## Components to Modify

### 1. WordTokenizer
```python
@dataclass
class WordToken:
    word: str
    leading_spaces: int
    trailing_spaces: int
    original_index: int
    # Add a flag to indicate if spaces are required for word boundary preservation
    preserve_spaces: bool = True
```

### 2. DPSolver
```python
def _try_character_interleaving(self, s1_token: WordToken, s2_token: WordToken) -> dict:
    # Ensure spaces between words are preserved
    # Never remove spaces that are required for word boundary preservation
    # ...
```

### 3. PathReconstructor
```python
def _build_content_from_strategy(self, s1_token: WordToken, s2_token: WordToken, strategy: str) -> str:
    # Ensure spaces between words are preserved in the final output
    # ...
```

### 4. SubsequenceVerifier
```python
def verify(self, s1: str, s2: str, output: str) -> VerificationResult:
    # Add verification for word boundary preservation
    # ...
```

## Test Case Example
```python
def test_word_boundary_preservation():
    s1 = "this is a red vase"
    s2 = "his son freddy love vase"
    # Expected output should maintain word boundaries with spaces
    expected = "this isonafreddy love vase"
    # Test that spaces between words are preserved
    # ...
```

## Implementation Strategy
1. Update the WordToken class to track required spaces for word boundaries
2. Modify the DP algorithm to respect word boundaries during optimization
3. Update the path reconstruction to preserve spaces between words
4. Enhance the verification logic to check for word boundary preservation
5. Add specific test cases to verify the fix

## Expected Output Example
```
s1: "this is a red vase"
s2: "his son freddy love vase"

expected_merged: "this isonafreddy love vase"

s1_in_merged:    "this is  a red        vase"
s2_in_merged:    " his  son freddy love vase"
```
