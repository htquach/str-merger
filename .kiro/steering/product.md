# Shortest Combined String Algorithm

## Product Overview
The Shortest Combined String Algorithm is a text merging tool that combines two sentences into the shortest possible string while preserving both original sentences as subsequences. It uses dynamic programming to find optimal combinations that maximize character reuse.

## Core Functionality
- Takes two input strings and produces an optimized combined string
- Ensures both input strings can be read as subsequences in the output
- Preserves word integrity and proper spacing
- Maximizes character reuse through advanced optimization strategies
- Minimizes the total length of the result

## Key Features
- Word-level processing with boundary preservation
- Space handling that maintains readability
- Comprehensive input validation and preprocessing
- Edge case handling for special scenarios
- Optimization metrics to measure efficiency
- Subsequence verification to ensure correctness

## Primary Test Case
The algorithm is designed to handle the primary test case:
- s1="this is a red vase"
- s2="his son freddy love vase"
- Expected output: â‰¤ 26 characters while maintaining both inputs as subsequences
