# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Python algorithm to find the shortest possible combined string that contains two input sentences as subsequences while preserving word integrity and maximizing character reuse. The algorithm must use dynamic programming to achieve optimal length reduction while maintaining the integrity of both input strings as subsequences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Subsequence Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer using this algorithm, I want both input strings to be preserved as subsequences in the output, so that no information from either original string is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the algorithm processes two input strings THEN the output string SHALL contain the first input string as a subsequence
2. WHEN the algorithm processes two input strings THEN the output string SHALL contain the second input string as a subsequence
3. WHEN verifying subsequence preservation THEN all characters from each input string SHALL appear in the same relative order in the output

### Requirement 2: Length Optimization

**User Story:** As a user of this algorithm, I want the shortest possible combined string, so that storage and processing efficiency is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing the test case s1="this is a red vase" and s2="his son freddy love vase" THEN the output length SHALL be ≤ 26 characters
2. WHEN multiple solutions exist with the same optimal length THEN any valid solution SHALL be acceptable
3. WHEN the algorithm completes THEN it SHALL produce the globally optimal solution (shortest possible length)

### Requirement 3: Character Reuse Optimization

**User Story:** As a user optimizing string storage, I want maximum character reuse between input strings, so that the combined output is as compact as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common characters exist between input strings THEN the algorithm SHALL maximize character reuse without violating subsequence requirements
2. WHEN characters can be shared strategically THEN the algorithm SHALL prioritize sharing over duplication
3. WHEN spaces exist in input strings THEN they SHALL be handled strategically for optimal alignment
4. WHEN matching characters between input strings THEN a word or character from one string SHALL be allowed to match with a space from another string (e.g., for s1="aa bb" and s2="cc", a valid result could be "aaccbb" where the space in s1 is matched with "cc" from s2)

### Requirement 4: Word Integrity and Space Handling

**User Story:** As a user processing text with spaces, I want proper space handling that maintains word integrity, so that the output remains readable and valid while preserving all original words.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing input strings THEN all words from both strings SHALL be included in the output
2. WHEN handling spaces THEN spaces SHALL NOT be inserted within any word
3. WHEN input strings contain existing spaces THEN those spaces SHALL NOT be removed
4. WHEN strategic spacing can improve alignment THEN additional spaces MAY be added next to existing spaces
5. WHEN output formatting is needed THEN leading and trailing spaces SHALL be trimmed from the final result
6. WHEN padding is beneficial for optimization THEN leading and trailing spaces MAY be added during processing
7. WHEN combining words from different strings THEN spaces between words from different strings have no semantic meaning
8. WHEN multiple optimal solutions exist with equal length THEN the algorithm SHALL choose the solution with the fewest total spaces

### Requirement 5: Algorithm Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer implementing this solution, I want a dynamic programming approach, so that the algorithm is efficient and produces optimal results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the core algorithm THEN it SHALL use dynamic programming approach
2. WHEN analyzing time complexity THEN it SHALL be O(n*m) where n and m are input string lengths
3. WHEN analyzing space complexity THEN it SHALL be O(n*m) for the DP table
4. WHEN considering iterations in the DP algorithm THEN each consideration SHALL start with substring that starts and ends with whole words

### Requirement 6: Input Validation and Preprocessing

**User Story:** As a user providing input strings, I want proper input validation and preprocessing, so that the algorithm works with clean, standardized input data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input strings contain two or more consecutive spaces THEN the algorithm SHALL detect this condition and flag it
2. WHEN consecutive spaces are detected THEN the algorithm SHALL automatically convert them into a single space
3. WHEN input preprocessing occurs THEN the algorithm SHALL notify the user of any automatic conversions made

### Requirement 7: Output Validation and Verification

**User Story:** As a user of this algorithm, I want built-in verification of results, so that I can trust the output correctness and understand the optimization achieved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the algorithm produces output THEN it SHALL verify that the output contains both input strings as subsequences
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN the program SHALL report the length savings achieved
3. WHEN edge cases occur (empty strings, identical strings, etc.) THEN the algorithm SHALL handle them gracefully
4. WHEN verification fails THEN the program SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the issue
5. WHEN either input string is empty THEN it SHALL be considered a valid subsequence of any output string
6. WHEN both input strings are empty THEN the verification SHALL always return valid regardless of output content

### Requirement 8: Test Case Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer testing this algorithm, I want comprehensive test coverage including edge cases, so that I can ensure reliability across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the primary case THEN s1="this is a red vase", s2="his son freddy love vase" SHALL produce output ≤ 26 characters
2. WHEN testing identical strings THEN the output SHALL equal the input string
3. WHEN one string contains the other THEN the output SHALL equal the longer string
4. WHEN strings have no common characters THEN the output length SHALL equal the sum of input lengths
5. WHEN writing test assertions THEN use `is_invalid` property instead of `not is_valid` for clearer test readability
